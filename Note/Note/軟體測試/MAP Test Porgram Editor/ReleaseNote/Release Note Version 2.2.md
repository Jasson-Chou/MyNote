10. Improved user experience when selecting ComboBox options, eliminating the need for additional mouse clicks.  
11. Enhanced various user experience operations.

14. Fixed Search/Replace Text positioning functionality.  
15. Addressed various known issues.  

**Technical Updates**  
1. Updated the mapping relationship between Source Files (signal, flow, ...) and UI (Field Mapper), enabling easier future additions and deletions. (Versions after 2.2 support seamless downgrades, with 2.2 as the minimum version.)  

**Known Issues**  
1. In rare cases, Visual Studio builds may fail. (Manually open the generated Visual Studio project and check for failure reasons.)  
2. The edited status symbol may be triggered when opening the editor. (Resolved but under observation.)  
3. In the Signal screen, editing the Pin Setting Tab triggers the unsaved file symbol (*). (Users will be prompted to save previous edits when switching to the Signal tab.)  

**Future Plans**  
1. Continued maintenance of Flow Table Bin distribution, with plans to fully transition to Bin Table in a future 2.X version.  
2. Upgrade Telerik components and update .NET Framework 4.6.1 to a newer version in 2.X.  
3. Add Search/Replace Text targeting specific file groups (e.g., Flow Table files within the current Solution).
